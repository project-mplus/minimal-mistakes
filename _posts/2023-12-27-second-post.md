Team MPlus 



"Over our years in the industry, we've come to recognize that there is a substantial gap between the conventional teachings of universities and the ever-evolving demands of today's industries." The inspiration for our project came from the realization that a large number of educated young people needed a full set of values and abilities necessary for navigating the constantly changing terrain those said difficulties. In order to bridge this gap, The MPlus Project was started as a "Pilot Project" at the University of Peradeniya's Faculty of Engineering and will be implemented island-wide with a strong confidence in the ability of educated youth to create the future. In order to prepare the next generation for the challenges of the modern world, our goal is to create a platform that not only fosters academic knowledge but also instills ethical principles and practical skills.

MPlus is dedicated to all educated youth, especially recent graduates and current students. We extend our reach to students, graduates, and the idled youth. This initiative is tailored to anyone seeking to enhance their skills, broaden their horizons, and be part of a vibrant community of learners and doers. Whether you are a recent graduate looking to launch your career, an experienced professional seeking to share your knowledge, or a student eager to learn and grow, MPlus is designed for you. Additionally, the initiative involved a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Peradeniya, industry professionals, seasoned academics, and corporate entities eager to collaborate in shaping the educational landscape. Ultimately, the entire Sri Lankan community is a stakeholder in this initiative, as it aims to contribute to the country's development through a skilled and empowered youth.
